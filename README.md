# Stock Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze sentiment related to stocks using natural language processing techniques. By analyzing news articles, tweets, or other textual data related to specific stocks, we attempt to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards those stocks.

## Overview

- **Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhamptrivedi/sentiment-analysis-for-dow-jones-djia-stock/input
- **Methodology**: Natural Language Processing - Random Forest Classifier - Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation**: Classification Metrics - metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score - Confusion Matrix
- **Dependencies**: Libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib, sk-learn, Regular Expression, nlptk, Requests (Bag of words, Count Vectorization)
- **File Structure**: 2 Files: 1. Data file 2. .py file

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the sentiment analysis code:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: https://github.com/VidhyaPriya17/stock_sentiment_analysis.git

3. **Preprocess Data**: If necessary, preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and vectorizing text data.

4. **Train Model**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data. This step may involve feature extraction and model selection

5. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.

6. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make sentiment predictions on new textual data related to stocks.
